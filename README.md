# Coustmer-Churn-Predection


# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. The entire analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Objectives

- Understand the factors that influence customer churn.
- Build predictive models to identify potential churners.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

## Dataset

(Describe your dataset here: origin, features, and target variable. Example below.)

The dataset contains customer records including demographic information, account details, and service usage metrics. The target variable indicates whether a customer has churned (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- `data/` - Raw and processed datasets (not included for privacy).
- `README.md` - Project documentation (this file).
- (Add or update folders/files as appropriate.)

## Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   - Load and inspect the data
   - Handle missing values and outliers
   - Encode categorical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualizations to understand feature distributions and correlations
   - Insights into churn patterns

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creation of new predictive features
   - Feature selection techniques

4. **Model Building**
   - Train-test split
   - Model selection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Hyperparameter tuning

5. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
   - Confusion matrix analysis

6. **Conclusion & Recommendations**
   - Key findings
   - Business recommendations to reduce churn

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bhargav250804/Coustmer-Churn-Predection.git
   cd Coustmer-Churn-Predection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(or manually install numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.)*

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   and open the main notebook file.
